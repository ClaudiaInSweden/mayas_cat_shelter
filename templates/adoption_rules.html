            <p class="card-text">To adopt a cat from a cat shelter involves a lot of responsibility. Cats who come to
              our cat shelter have often been homeless for some reasons, or need a new home due to illness or death of
              their previous owners. We don't want our cats to go through such a traumatic experience again so we are
              very carefully in chosing a new, forever home. </p>
              <p>Questions you need to ask yourself:</p>
              <ul class="pawlist">
                <li>Does your financial situation allow for unexpected expenditures, like acute veterinary care which can be expensive even with an insurance? </li>
                <li>Can you afford high-quality food, litter and insurance even in a couple of years? </li>
                <li>Do you have enough time for a cat? </li>
                <li>Is there a risk that you need to move to a place where pets are not allowed?</li>
                <li>Do you have somebody who can take care of the cat if you are sick or when you travel? </li>
              </ul>
